<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Eric</h1>

<h3 align="left">About Me:</h3>
<p>
  I am a 2nd-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of York with a strong interest in machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning. My long-term goal is to eventually get into intelligent robotics after developing a solid understanding of machine learning.
</p>
<p>
  For some background: although I'm currently studying at university, all of the projects featured on this profile are entirely extracurricular, and every concept, model, and algorithm you see here is self-taught. Initially, in 2022, I decided to learn Java through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java">Codecademy's beginner course</a> and then moved on to a more advanced <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/">Udemy Java course</a>.
</p>
<p>
  After taking a short break, I became deeply interested in AI in June 2024, starting with simple algorithms like Minimax, Expectimax, and Q-Learning. I taught myself these concepts using a combination of LLMs, YouTube tutorials, and articles from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksForGeeks</a>.
</p>
<p>
  After an early failed attempt at applying Q-Learning to the game 2048 (more details in <a href="https://github.com/Bloodaxe90/2048-Q-Learning">this repo</a>), I realized I needed a stronger foundation in Python and machine learning. In early August 2024, I began learning Python—primarily through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0">Bro Code’s complete Python course on YouTube</a>—and then moved on to neural networks using Simon Prince’s free textbook, <em>Understanding Deep Learning</em>, supported by LLMs.
</p>
<p>
  With that foundational knowledge in place, I taught myself PyTorch using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA&t=20s">freeCodeCamp’s beginner tutorial</a>. From there, throughout 2025, I explored deeper concepts using the resources mentioned above, as well as key research papers like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">"Attention Is All You Need"</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Topics I’ve explored so far include:
  <ul>
    <li>Actor-Critic and Policy Gradient Methods</li>
    <li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and GRUs</li>
    <li>Transformers and Self-Attention</li>
    <li>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</li>
    <li>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</li>
    <li>Diffusion Models (most recently)</li>
  </ul>

<h3 align="left">My Work:</h3>
<p>
  Every project on this profile was created to test and apply what I had just learned. Many were originally designed for my own use only and so I’ve since adapted them to be more accessible to others. Just keep that in mind while browsing my repositories.
